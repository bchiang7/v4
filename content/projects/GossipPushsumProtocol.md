This project simulates the gossip and push-sum distributed communication algorithms using F# and the Akka framework. The gossip algorithm and push-sum algorithm are run on various network topologies. The convergence time for both methods is calculated for four different network topologies (Line, 2D Grid, Imperfect 3D grid, Full).
