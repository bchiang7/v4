- Created a fuse box assembly defect detection system that identifies incorrect fuse placements based on colors. Eliminated the need for human inspection, resulting in reduced operating expenses and labor-intensive quality control
- Utilized Image Processing and a two-step Neural Network with TensorFlow and Faster RCNN models to detect improper fuse box configurations in images, videos, and live feeds. Enhanced model efficiency and performance through dataset creation, augmentation, and fine-tuning techniques
- Developed a desktop application with GUI interface, packaging the model for user-friendly usage. Added business requirements such as generating PDF reports with detailed results for each fuse box, charts, total error rate, and most frequent errors for auditing
