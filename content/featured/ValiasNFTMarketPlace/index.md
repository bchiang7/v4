A web 3.0 application built on the Flow blockchain. Valias is a NFT marketplace where you can create, buy, and sell NFTs. I am currently working on this project with two of my friends. I joined about halfway through development but have contributing consistently. React was used for the front end, express for backend, Cadence for the smart contracts, and IPFS, Pinata and Postgres for database. The site is hosted on Heroku.
