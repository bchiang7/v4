A full-stack MERN application. I led and managed a team of 3 other engineers to create a full-stack MERN app for university students to rate and review their university classes.
Fully deployed and continue to maintain the front and back end with AWS using Route 53, load balancers, EC2s, VPC. Created the routes for the back-end using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. Developed about 25% of the front-end using React.
