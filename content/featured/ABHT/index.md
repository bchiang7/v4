I've designed a management system for public works contracts and service orders (start, stop and resume), work locations and more.

As a presentation layer i've used .NET platform, winforms using C# for building my desktop application enhanced with [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/)'s powerful & nice-looking components.
