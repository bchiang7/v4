During this confinement period, I realized that the preventative and healthy measurements taken by governments and Docker to emphasis isolation are somehow similar and symmetrical.

I was inspired by this post below https://lnkd.in/dU_XQxK from the community
on twitter recently, to remind the three main linux kernel features used by Docker under the hood to maintain isolation between containers.

Containers are safe because they are respecting Docker isolation measures, what about you?

## Questions

How governments and Docker are using similar ways to ensure isolation for your safety?<br/>
Which features?<br/>
What are these isolation levels ?<br/>

Governments emphasizes on isolation of

so that people won't infect each other.

## The post

Here i explain how are the measures taken by Docker and governments are similar to contain diseases
